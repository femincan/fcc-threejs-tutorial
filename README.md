# freeCodecamp Three.js Tutorial

This repository contains the codes for the freeCodeCamp Three.js Tutorial on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel

I prefer create each project with Vite due to support of HMR, and TypeScript support.

I also prefer Bun as the runtime because of its good performance.
